*SHOP is still in early alpha mode, many features are still being built - If you download a newer nightly build then do not attempt to upgrade unless you understand the system. It is recommended that you install a fresh copy each time.*

I created the SHOP program because there is a lack of ecommerce options for PyroCMS. The idea behind SHOP is to create a `FREE` and open platform for designers to rapidly set up a ecommerce website using PyroCMS. SHOP has many free built in features by default, you will not need any more addons or plugins to setup a ecommerce site.

If you want to contact myself or take part in developing please feel free to email me at: sal@nitrocart.net
