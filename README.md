*SHOP is still in early alpha mode, many features are still being built - If you download a newer nightly build then do not attempt to upgrade unless you understand the system. It is recommended that you install a fresh copy each time.*

## Introduction

I created the SHOP program because there is a lack of ecommerce options for `PyroCMS`. The idea behind SHOP is to create a `FREE` and open platform for designers to rapidly set up a ecommerce website using `PyroCMS`.
